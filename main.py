Instead, she has used it as a driving force, pushing past limitations and shattering barriers to become one of the leading sprinters in the world.
Early Life and Diagnosis
Born on April 26, 1996, in the United Kingdom, Olivia Breen was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at a young age.

From a young age, Olivia had an interest in sports. Initially, she started participating in a variety of physical activities, from swimming to athletics. It was in athletics, specifically sprinting, where she would find her true passion and shine on the global stage.
Path to Paralympic Glory
Olivia's journey into Paralympic athletics began when she was introduced to the sport by a local disability sports club. The supportive environment and competitive nature of athletics appealed to Olivia, and she began to show promise in sprinting. She joined a training group and started working with coaches who could help her harness her potential.
Her breakthrough moment came in 2012 when she was selected to represent Great Britain at the London Paralympic Games.

Her performance was a testament to her years of preparation, grit, and commitment to her craft.
Over the years, Olivia continued to build her medal collection at major international competitions, including the World Championships and the European Championships.
